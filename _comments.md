## After MP2-B

* When you use an image to hold the brand make sure to enter the brand text in an `alt` attribute.
* Avoid forcing capitalization in your content and favor using CSS `text-transform` so that you have flexibility to easily change this later. 
* Make sure to make use of the microformatting we discussed in class Tuesday in your product thumbnails.
* Use `input` for the quantity value and `button` for the "Add to cart"
* Good organization on the ratings list; just use the microformatting we discussed Tuesday. Also consider a `div` around the review text in case a review is ever more than one `p`.
